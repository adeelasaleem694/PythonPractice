```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python_Practice.git
cd Python_Practice
jupyter notebook
```

## Practice Topics

This repository includes the following topics I've been working on:

- Basic Python syntax and operations
- Data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
