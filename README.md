# Python Practices  

Welcome to my **Python Practices Repository**! üöÄ  
This is where I document my learning journey, starting from Python basics like tuples, lists, and more. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Python while preparing for advanced topics like **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** in the future.

## üóÇÔ∏è **What's Inside?**  

You'll find practice examples, scripts, and notebooks covering a wide range of topics:  

### **Core Python Concepts**  
- Basic syntax, operations, and Python essentials.  

### **Data Structures**  
- Exploring and implementing lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more.  

### **Algorithms**  
- Hands-on practice with sorting, searching, and problem-solving techniques.  

### **Data Analysis**  
- Using **Pandas** to manipulate and analyze datasets.  

### **Data Visualization**  
- Crafting insightful visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- Understanding classes, objects, and key OOP principles.  

### **Error Handling**  
- Writing robust code using exception handling and file operations.
