## üí° **Example Questions**
Here are some example problems from the collection:

### **Basic Tuple Operations**
```python
# Create a tuple with 5 elements and print its length.
tuple_example = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(len(tuple_example))
# Output: 5
```

### **Tuple Unpacking**
```python
# Unpack a tuple of unknown length using `*` syntax.
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
first, *middle, last = numbers
print(first, middle, last)
# Output: 1 [2, 3, 4] 5
```

### **Tuple Applications**
```python
# Write a program to create a tuple of even numbers from 1 to 20.
even_numbers = tuple(x for x in range(1, 21) if x % 2 == 0)
print(even_numbers)
# Output: (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)
```
