# Python Lists Practice

 contains my  practice notebooks and exercises related to **lists in Python**. I'm learning and experimenting with various aspects of lists, including creation, manipulation, slicing, methods, comprehensions, and applications.

## Usage

To use the notebooks in this repository, simply clone this repository and open the notebook files in Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python_Lists_Practice.git
cd Python_Lists_Practice
jupyter notebook
```

## Practice Topics

This repository contains the following list-related topics I've been working on:

### **Basic List Operations**
- Create a list of the first 10 natural numbers.
- Write a program to append a number to an existing list.
- Insert an element at the 2nd index of a list.
- Remove the first occurrence of a specific element from a list.
- Delete the element at index 3 of a list.
- Find the length of a list.
- Check if a specific element exists in a list.

### **Indexing and Slicing**
- Access the first and last elements of a list.
- Extract a sublist containing the 2nd to 5th elements.
- Reverse a list using slicing.
- Get every alternate element from a list.
- Slice a list to get all elements except the last two.

### **List Methods**
- Sort a list in ascending and descending order.
- Find the maximum and minimum values in a list.
- Count the occurrences of a specific element in a list.
- Extend one list with another list.
- Clear all elements from a list.

### **List Comprehensions**
- Create a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10.
- Generate a list of all even numbers between 1 and 20 using list comprehension.
- Create a list of all numbers divisible by 3 from a given range.
- Convert a list of strings to uppercase using list comprehension.
- Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number and its cube for numbers 1-5.

### **Advanced Manipulations**
- Write a program to find the sum of all elements in a list.
- Multiply all elements of a list by 2.
- Remove all duplicates from a list.
- Rotate a list to the left by one position.
- Find the second largest number in a list.

### **Nested Lists**
- Access the second element of each sublist in a nested list.
- Flatten a nested list into a single list.
- Transpose a 2D list (list of lists).
- Write a program to create a 3x3 matrix and print it.
- Check if a nested list contains a specific value.

### **Applications**
- Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.
- Write a program to find the intersection of two lists.
- Find the union of two lists without duplicates.
- Write a program to check if two lists are equal.
- Create a list of Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.

### **Special Challenges**
- Find all sublists of a given list.
- Write a program to find all permutations of a list.
- Generate a list of prime numbers less than 50.
- Write a program to shift all zeros in a list to the end, maintaining the order of other elements.
- Split a list into two halves.

### **Sorting and Searching**
- Sort a list of strings based on their lengths.
- Write a program to find the position of the first occurrence of a number in a list.
- Use binary search to find an element in a sorted list.
- Write a program to sort a list of tuples by the second element.

### **String and List Interactions**
- Split a string into a list of words.
- Join a list of words into a single string separated by spaces.
- Convert a list of integers to a single string (e.g., `[1, 2, 3] -> '123'`).
- Count the number of palindromes in a list of strings.

### **Functions and Lists**
- Write a function that takes a list as input and returns the largest number.
- Implement a function that removes all negative numbers from a list.
- Write a function that takes a list and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each element.
- Create a function that checks if a list is a palindrome.

### **Error Handling**
- Handle errors gracefully when accessing an index out of range in a list.
- Handle exceptions when converting elements of a list to integers.
